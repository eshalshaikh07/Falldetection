# Real-Time Motion Monitoring with MPU6050 and MATLAB 🕹️📊

This project utilizes the **MPU6050** sensor to monitor and track pitch and roll angles in real time. The data is collected through an Arduino or other microcontroller and sent to a MATLAB interface, where it is visualized with continuous updates. The project can be extended to various applications such as fall detection, actuator testing, and abnormality detection in industrial settings.

## Features ✨
- **Real-time Motion Monitoring**: Collect and visualize pitch and roll angles over time. 📉
- **Dynamic Plot Updates**: The graph updates instantly with new data from the MPU6050 sensor. 🔄
- **Baseline Calibration**: The system stores and maintains baseline values for pitch and roll angles for comparison. 📏
- **Deviation Detection**: Detects when the pitch or roll angle exceeds a predefined threshold (e.g., abnormal posture, falls, etc.). ⚠️
- **Applications**: The system can be applied to various fields like healthcare, industrial automation, and robotics. 🏥🏭🤖

## Prerequisites 🛠️
- **MPU6050 Sensor**: An accelerometer and gyroscope sensor used for measuring pitch, roll, and yaw.
- **Microcontroller**: Arduino, ESP32, or any similar microcontroller to interface with the MPU6050.
- **MATLAB**: For data visualization and real-time plotting.
- **Serial Communication**: The microcontroller sends data to MATLAB via a serial connection.

## Installation 📦

### Hardware Setup ⚙️
1. Connect the **MPU6050** sensor to your microcontroller. Typically, you will connect the SDA and SCL pins of the sensor to the corresponding pins on the microcontroller.
2. Use the **I2C** interface to communicate between the microcontroller and the MPU6050 sensor.

### Software Setup 💻
1. Install MATLAB with support for serial communication.
2. Install the necessary libraries for reading from the MPU6050 sensor, such as the **MPU6050** library for Arduino or a similar I2C-based library.
3. Upload the appropriate code to your microcontroller that reads the MPU6050 data and sends it to MATLAB via serial communication.
4. Run the provided MATLAB script to visualize real-time pitch and roll data.

## Code Walkthrough 📝
The MATLAB script continuously reads data from the serial port, which includes the pitch and roll angles. The script then updates two plots showing the real-time values. If the deviation from the baseline exceeds a predefined threshold, the plot will change color to alert the user.

### Code Breakdown:
- **Baseline Initialization**: The first time the data is received, the baseline values for pitch and roll are set.
- **Real-time Data Reception**: Continuous reading of pitch and roll data, with updates to the plot every time new data is received.
- **Deviation Detection**: If the deviation from the baseline exceeds the threshold, the plot's color will change (e.g., red for abnormal deviation).
- **Plot Updates**: The `drawnow` function is used to update the plot in real time.

## Applications 📍

### 1. **Fall Detection in Healthcare 👴🏼🛏️**
The system can be used for monitoring elderly people or patients at risk of falling. By setting a threshold for abnormal pitch or roll angles, the system can detect if a person has fallen, allowing for quick emergency responses.

- **How it works**: If the pitch or roll angle exceeds the threshold (indicating a fall), an alert is triggered. 🚨
- **Use case**: Hospitals, elderly care centers, or home monitoring systems.

### 2. **Actuator Testing in Robotics 🤖🛠️**
In industrial automation or robotics, actuators are often tested for movement accuracy and reliability. By using this system, one can monitor the performance of actuators during testing by comparing the expected angles (based on input commands) with the actual pitch and roll measured during operation.

- **How it works**: The system detects deviations from expected angles during actuator movement, ensuring the actuator is functioning as intended.
- **Use case**: Robotics testing, mechanical engineering, quality control.

### 3. **Abnormality Detection in Industrial Settings 🏭⚙️**
In industries where precise movements are required (such as in CNC machines, robotic arms, or assembly lines), any deviation in the motion or posture could be a sign of mechanical issues or errors. This system can monitor the angles of moving parts and detect abnormalities in real time.

- **How it works**: The system monitors the motion angles and alerts the user when deviations exceed safe operational ranges. ⚠️
- **Use case**: Manufacturing plants, CNC machines, automated production lines.

### 4. **Posture Monitoring for Ergonomics 👨‍💻🧑‍🏭**
This system can be used to monitor the posture of workers to prevent long-term musculoskeletal issues. By analyzing pitch and roll angles, the system can detect poor posture and recommend corrective actions to improve ergonomics.

- **How it works**: The system continuously monitors a worker’s posture and provides real-time feedback when the posture deviates from the optimal range. 
- **Use case**: Office work environments, manufacturing floors, and healthcare professionals.

## Accuracy 🔍
Currently, the accuracy of the MPU6050-based system depends on several factors, including sensor calibration, noise in the sensor data, and the precision of the microcontroller’s readings. In its current state, the accuracy may be less than ideal, but **with proper calibration and adjustments**, the system has a **great potential for high accuracy**. 

### Future Scope for Improvement:
- **Sensor Calibration**: The accuracy of the pitch and roll readings can be improved by properly calibrating the MPU6050 sensor, reducing noise, and compensating for sensor drift over time.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Implementing advanced filtering algorithms like **Kalman filters** or **complementary filters** can help smooth the data and improve the accuracy of the angle measurements.
- **Enhanced Algorithms**: Integrating machine learning algorithms can help better classify deviations, especially in dynamic environments, and improve fall detection accuracy.
- **Multiple Sensor Fusion**: Combining data from multiple MPU6050 sensors can increase the system's robustness and accuracy for complex applications like actuator testing or abnormality detection.

While the accuracy of the current implementation may be limited, with these modifications and enhancements, the system holds great promise for a wide range of industrial, healthcare, and robotic applications. 🚀

## How to Use 🎮
1. **Connect your hardware**: Ensure the MPU6050 is connected and configured correctly.
2. **Run the MATLAB script**: Once the microcontroller is sending data, run the MATLAB script. It will start reading data, plot the real-time pitch and roll angles, and monitor for any deviations.
3. **Configure thresholds**: Customize the deviation thresholds for your specific application (e.g., fall detection or actuator testing).
4. **Observe results**: The plot will show the real-time data, and deviations from the baseline will trigger visual alerts on the plot. 🔴

## Troubleshooting 🛠️
- **Data not updating**: Ensure the microcontroller is correctly connected to MATLAB and that serial communication is properly configured.
- **Inaccurate readings**: Calibrate the MPU6050 sensor or adjust the thresholds to match the expected range of movement.
- **Plot not updating**: Ensure the `drawnow` function is being called after each update.

## Future Enhancements 🔮
- **Multiple sensor support**: Extend the system to handle data from multiple sensors simultaneously for more complex systems (e.g., monitoring multiple actuators).
- **Wireless communication**: Implement a wireless system using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi to send data from the sensor to MATLAB.
- **Machine learning integration**: Use machine learning to classify abnormal postures or movements for more advanced fall detection and monitoring.
